# Test Result File

## Testing Protocol
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing, ASK user whether to test frontend
- ONLY test frontend if user explicitly requests
- NEVER invoke frontend testing without user permission

## Current Task
Implementation of detailed 2-line display for closed trades in the cryptocurrency trading bot GUI.

## Changes Made
1. **Enhanced `add_closed_trade_to_history` function**: Modified to display closed trades on 2 lines with rich formatting
   - Line 1: Date/Time, Symbol, Entry â†’ Exit Price, Net P&L (with color), Duration
   - Line 2: Reason for closure, Final Momentum, Total Fees, Take Profit info
2. **Added rich color coding**: Different colors for profits/losses, detailed information
3. **Added emoji indicators**: Visual indicators for different types of information

The cryptocurrency trading bot has been successfully tested and both critical fixes are working correctly: 1) TRADING STRATEGY FIX: Bot now buys RISING trends (+1%) instead of falling (-1%) - the illogical strategy of buying declining assets has been corrected. 2) P&L CALCULATION FIX: Total P&L now accurately combines realized P&L from closed trades + unrealized P&L from open positions, providing accurate accounting based on actual trade results. All 8 backend tests passed successfully. The bot is ready for production use with the corrected trading logic and accurate P&L calculations."
