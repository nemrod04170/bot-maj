The previous AI engineer initiated work on a Python-based cryptocurrency trading bot, identified as . Initially misinterpreting it as a full-stack application, the AI quickly corrected its understanding to a standalone Python project upon inspecting the file system.

The core task involved externalizing hardcoded values from the codebase into a  file, ensuring all configurable parameters (except API keys, which reside in ) are managed externally. This process led to several iterations of refactoring, including handling parsing issues due to comments in  and ensuring proper type conversions for numeric values.

Subsequent work focused on fixing functional issues: addressing incorrect file paths for state saving, resolving  value propagation due to missing defaults post-externalization, and correcting the Reset Simulation functionality to properly clear open positions and refresh the GUI. A significant clarification around trading strategy was made, confirming the bot should only perform LONG trades, which necessitated updates to the trade execution and monitoring logic. The AI then implemented a dynamic Take Profit system based on market indicators and enhanced portfolio and fee tracking for clearer reporting. The most recent task initiated is improving the display of closed trades.

<product_requirements>
The user's primary goal is to enhance and maintain a Python-based cryptocurrency scalping bot. The key requirements and implemented changes are:
*   **Configuration Externalization**: All hardcoded parameters (e.g., trading thresholds, percentages, intervals) must be moved to , with API keys remaining in .
*   **Functional Stability**: Ensure the bot runs without errors, including correct state saving (), proper handling of configuration values, and responsive GUI elements like Reset Simulation.
*   **Trading Logic Refinement**:
    *   The bot must **only** perform LONG trades (buy then sell), even if a SELL signal is detected. SELL signals should be ignored for opening new positions.
    *   Stop Loss (SL) should always be *below* the entry price, and Take Profit (TP) *above* the entry price for LONG positions.
    *   Implement a **dynamic Take Profit** mechanism that adjusts the TP percentage based on market conditions (RSI, volume spike, pump, crypto type) to let profits run.
    *   Implement **intelligent position monitoring** to prevent premature closure by timeout if momentum is positive, instead selling when momentum stagnates or declines.
*   **Reporting and Transparency**:
    *   Ensure the portfolio value, P&L, and trade results are accurately and clearly displayed in the GUI.
    *   Add a **sum of total fees** incurred to the dashboard for a realistic view of profitability.
    *   Provide a **detailed 2-line display** for closed trades, showing key information and technical details.

<code_architecture>
The project is a Python-based cryptocurrency trading bot. It's structured with a root  directory containing several Python files and configuration.



-   : Provides a high-level overview of the bot (async scalping bot).
-   : Critical for externalizing all configurable parameters. Initially contained comments that caused parsing issues; these were subsequently removed.
-   : Responsible for loading parameters from  and providing access to them. It was extensively modified to ensure correct parsing of numeric values and handle the absence of default values.
-   : The Tkinter GUI application. Significant modifications were made to:
    -   Correctly handle  path for state saving.
    -   Implement a robust Reset Simulation feature to clear open positions and refresh the display.
    -   Update dashboard displays for P&L, total portfolio value, and newly added total fees.
    -   Adjust the display of open positions to correctly show Stop Loss and Take Profit values for LONG-only trades.
    -   Start implementing a detailed 2-line display for closed trades.
-   : Contains the core trading logic, including:
    -   Position opening, closing, and management.
    -   Calculation of P&L and fees.
    -   Implementation of Stop Loss and Take Profit.
    -   Logic was refined to ensure only LONG trades are opened, ignoring SELL signals for new positions.
    -   The  (later replaced/modified to  then intelligent monitoring) function was a key area of change for dynamic TP and intelligent exit logic.
    -   Tracking of  was added and integrated into state saving/loading.
-   : Module responsible for identifying trading opportunities based on market criteria. It was modified to ensure numeric values from  are correctly converted before calculations to avoid type errors.
-   : Stores sensitive API keys, explicitly stated not to be modified by the AI.

The overall architecture involves a configuration layer, a core trading engine, a market scanner, and a GUI for interaction, all communicating through Python objects and shared configuration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the display of finished trades (closed trades) in the GUI. The user explicitly requested more detail, displayed on two lines per trade, for clarity.

The AI engineer proposed a detailed format for the 2-line display, including:
*   **Line 1**: Date/Time, Symbol, Entry â†’ Exit Price, Net P&L (with color), Duration.
*   **Line 2**: Reason for closure (TP, SL, Momentum), Final Momentum, Total Fees, Initial vs. Final Take Profit, Performance %.
This proposed format also included conditional coloring (green for winners, red for losers).

The user confirmed this first version as perfect, indicating the AI was about to begin modifying  to implement this new display format. This involves updating the text rendering logic for the  widget in the GUI to parse the  data and format it into the requested multi-line, detailed output. This is a UI-centric task, relying on the underlying data structures and calculations already refined in .
